# Calculator App with Jenkins CI/CD

This project contains a calculator application with an automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.
The setup includes containerized Jenkins with Docker capabilities and automated Python testing.

## Directory Structure
 - app/                   # Calculator application
 - tests/                 # Test files
 - Dockerfile             # App Dockerfile
 - Dockerfile.jenkins     # Jenkins Dockerfile (include plugins install)
 - docker-compose.yml     # Services configuration
 - Jenkinsfile            # Pipeline definition
 - requirements.txt       # Python dependencies

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git installed
- Docker Hub account (for image pushing)

## Jenkins Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avichayef/datateam_calculator
cd datateam_calculator
```

2. Start Jenkins using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d jenkins
```

This will:
- Build a custom Jenkins container with Docker support
- Start Jenkins on port 8080
- Mount necessary volumes for persistence
- Configure Jenkins with root access for Docker operations

3. Access Jenkins:
- Open `http://localhost:8080` (or http://--VM IP--:8080) in browser
- Jenkins is configured to skip the setup wizard (`jenkins.install.runSetupWizard=false`)

## Jenkins Configuration

### Docker Hub Credentials Setup

1. Go to "Manage Jenkins" â†’ "Credentials"
2. Click on "System" under Stores scoped to Jenkins
3. Click "Global credentials"
4. Click "Add Credentials"
5. Select "Username with password"
6. Set the following:
   - Kind: Username with password
   - Scope: Global
   - Username: <Docker Hub username>
   - Password: <Docker Hub password>
   - ID: dockerhub-credentials
   - Description: Docker Hub Credentials

### Pipeline Setup

1. In Jenkins dashboard, click "New Item"
2. Enter a name ("calculator-pipeline")
3. Select "Pipeline"
4. In configuration:
   - Under "Pipeline", select "Pipeline script from SCM"
   - Select "Git" as SCM
   - Enter https://github.com/Avichayef/datateam_calculator
   - Set "Script Path" to "Jenkinsfile" and save

## Pipeline Stages

The pipeline consists of 3 stages:

1. **Test**
   - Runs in Python 3.13-slim container
   - Installs requirements
   - Executes pytest
   - Generates JUnit test reports

2. **Build Docker Image**
   - Builds calculator app image
   - Tags with build number and 'latest'

3. **Push to Docker Hub**
   - Log in to Docker Hub
   - Pushes images with version and 'latest' tags


## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ##

## Docker Compose Services

### Calculator Service
- Builds from project Dockerfile
- Mounts current directory
- Runs pytest with JUnit XML output

### Jenkins Service
- Custom build from Dockerfile.jenkins
- Exposed ports:
  - 8080 (Web UI)
  - 50000 (Agent communication)
- Volumes:
  - jenkins_home (persistence)
  - docker.sock (Docker access)

## Environment Variables

The pipeline uses:
- `PYTHON_IMAGE`: python:3.13-slim
- `BUILD_NUMBER`: Jenkins build number (automatic)
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username (from credentials)
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Docker Hub password (from credentials)

## Test Reports

- JUnit test reports are automatically collected
- Available in Jenkins build results
- Failed tests will mark the build as failed

## Helm Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Minikube installed and running
- Helm installed
- kubectl installed

### Deployment Steps

1. Start Minikube:
```bash
minikube start
```

2. Point to Minikube's Docker daemon:
```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

3. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t calculator:latest .
```

4. Deploy using Helm:
```bash
helm upgrade --install calculator ./helm/calculator
```

5. Verify deployment:
```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
```

6. Access the application:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/calculator-calculator 5000:80
```

### Testing the Deployment

1. Web Interface:
   - Open http://localhost:5000 in browser
   - Use the calculator interface

2. API Endpoints:
   - Health Check: `curl http://localhost:5000/health`
   - Calculate: 
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/calculate \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"a": 10, "b": 5, "operation": "+"}'
     ```
